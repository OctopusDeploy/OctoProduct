## Auditable deployments

If the visible pillar is about surfacing the current state of your environments and the changes were made as part of the release, then auditing is about tracking who has been involved in the deployment process over time.

Auditing allows teams to see a history of deployments to environments, changes to deployment processes, changes to environments, who approved which deployments, and determine the state of an environment at some point in the past.
