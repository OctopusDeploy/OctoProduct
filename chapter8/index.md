## Standardized deployments

Just as repeatable deployments build confidence as a release is promoted across environments, standardizing on deployment processes across different projects allows teams to leverage already proven processes to confidently deploy new projects.

There are two main aspects to standardizing deployments.

The first aspect is defining the initial deployment process that is used by the various deployments. This base deployment process can be a shared template that allows very specific settings to be customized, or the entire process could be copied and pasted to bootstrap new projects but otherwise allow them to customize the process to their own needs.

The second aspect is defining who has the ability to edit a deployment process. By distinguishing between the ability to view, run, create, and edit a deployment process, teams can provide guarantees that only those individuals with the responsibility to create or edit deployment processes can do so.
