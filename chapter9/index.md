## Maintainable deployments

Getting your deployments to the production environment is just the beginning. Diagnosing issues, collecting logs, performing backups, restarting services, rotating keys and testing connections are just some of the day to day operations tasks that keep your applications humming and your customers happy.

While you could SSH or RDP into a server and start poking around, each change you make drifts your production environment from your non-production environments, making it just that little bit harder to implement repeatable deployments. It is also difficult to track the changes that were made, verify that they worked, and audit who changed what.

Like deployments, maintenance tasks should be repeatable, verifiable, visible, measurable, and auditable. Maintenance tasks represent the business knowledge required to keep your deployments running, and should be held to the same standards as your deployment processes.
