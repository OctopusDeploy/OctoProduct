## Coordinated deployments

Actually deploying a package into an environment is just one small part of the deployment process. Often deployments need to be coordinated with other business processes to ensure:

* The right people have given their approval.
* Interested parties been notified of the success or failure of a deployment.
* Deployments proceed in the correct order.
* Deployments can only occur during specific times.
* High priority deployments take precedence over low priority ones.
* Deployments are scheduled to take place at a predetermined time.
