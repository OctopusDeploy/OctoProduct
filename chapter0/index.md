## Foreward

As you might imagine, we spend a great deal of time at Octopus thinking about deployments. Octopus was born to solve real world deployment processes, and continues to be shaped to this day through conversations with customers, support requests, our own internal deployment requirements, and many discussions around what we think good deployments look like.

This knowledge has been distilled into 10 pillars of pragmatic deployment processes, with specific examples demonstrating how the features of Octopus can be configured and integrated with Kubernetes and other associated tools.

We use the phrase "pragmatic" quite deliberately. This book is not a score card, a pyramid, a checklist, or a fixed list of requirements. In many cases Octopus, both as a product and as a company, have not achieved these pillars. One of the primary goals of writing this book was to find the gaps in our own processes in order to shape the features and philosophy of our product in future, and to continue the ongoing dissuasion on what it means to deploy software.

With that in mind, pillar number zero, and the prerequisite for all other pillars in this book, is *do what works for you*.

We hope you enjoy this book, and look forward to shaping the future of pragmatic deployments with your feedback.

Happy deployments!
