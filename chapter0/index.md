## Foreword

As you might imagine, at Octopus, we spend a great deal of time thinking about deployments. Octopus was born to manage real world deployment processes and continues to be shaped to this day through conversations with customers, support requests, our own internal deployment requirements, and many discussions around what we think good deployments look like.

This knowledge has been distilled into the 10 pillars of pragmatic deployments.

We use the phrase "pragmatic" quite deliberately. This list is not a score card, a pyramid, a checklist, or a fixed list of requirements. In many cases Octopus, both as a product and as a company, have not achieved these pillars. One of the primary goals of developing these pillars is to find the gaps in our own processes in order to shape the features and philosophy of our product, and to continue the ongoing discussion about what it means to deploy software.

With that in mind, pillar number zero, and the prerequisite for all other pillars in this list, is *do what works for you*.

We hope you enjoy this discussion, and look forward to shaping the future of pragmatic deployments with your feedback.

Happy deployments!
